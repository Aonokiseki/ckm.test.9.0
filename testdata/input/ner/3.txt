ZHUHAI/MACAO, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- A new port to facilitate travel between Macao and Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province, was officially put into use Tuesday, a new step to boost development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Dubbed a super passage, the main working area of the Hengqin port has a total floor area of 450,000 square meters, equivalent to 63 football fields. It has a designed daily capacity of 222,000 passengers, which can help ease the pressure of Gongbei Port and increase the daily capacity for passenger flow between Guangdong and Macao.

In 2019, the port saw a total of 145 million passengers, ranking first in China for eight consecutive years. However, the Gongbei Port has been running far beyond its designed capacity, thus resulting in a series of problems such as prolonged queuing time and slow customs clearance procedures. As a flagship project of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Hengqin Port significantly simplified clearance procedures. The opening of the new port will further enhance interconnectivity of Guangdong and Macao, provide more convenient, fast and considerate services for personnel, economic and trade exchanges, inject new impetus into the development of Hengqin New Area, and lay a solid foundation for deepening the Guangdong-Macao cooperation and advancing the building of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, said Ma Xingrui, governor of Guangdong.

(Xinhua/Cheong Kam Ka) The port has adopted a brand-new working pattern between Guangdong and Macao, further enriching the connotation of one country, two systems, according to Chief Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) Ho Iat Seng. The staff of the two sides work in the same office building and share the same equipment. The unprecedented management and construction model is new for Guangdong and Macao, he said. Chinese authorities in February 2019 unveiled the development outline for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, aiming to build the region into a role model of high-quality development. The Greater Bay Area consists of Hong Kong, Macao and nine cities of Guangdong Province. At around 3 p.m. Tuesday, a Macao resident surnamed Ieong became the first person to go through the self-checking passage at the new Hengqin port to enter Zhuhai. The process took her just 26 seconds. It's very convenient as I only need to use my ID once when crossing the port, Ieong said, adding that she was very excited to be the first person to make the crossing.

(Xinhua/Deng Hua) Previously, the Hengqin checkpoint in Zhuhai and the Lotus checkpoint in Macao were designed as separate customs clearance channels, which was inconvenient for travelers. The new Hengqin Port adopts a joint inspection and one-time release customs-clearance mode. According to official data, the number of Macao residents holding Zhuhai residence permits exceeds 50,000, and the total number of people who live in Zhuhai and work in Macao is more than 60,000. The new Hengqin Port's convenient inspection procedures are expected to increase the volume of travel.  Passengers pose for photos at Macao's border checkpoint at Hengqin Port on Aug. 18, 2020. (Xinhua/Cheong Kam Ka) In the first seven months of this year, the number of Macao-funded enterprises registered in Hengqin was more than double that for the same period last year. Liu Guangqian, who works at the Hengqin Port, has witnessed the changing relationship between Zhuhai and Macao. Tourists and laborers employed in Macao used to take up the bulk of crossings at this port. Now, there are more businessmen, workers and students crossing, he said. Inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by a Chinese pharmaceutical company are likely to be on the market by the end of December, at a price of less than 1,000 yuan ($144) for two doses. The marketing review procedure will start after overseas phase three clinical trials have been completed, Liu Jingzhen, chairman of the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), was quoted as saying by media on Tuesday. The price of the vaccines will not be high after they go onto the market, with every two doses costing less than 1,000 yuan, according to Liu. Not all 1.4 billion Chinese people need to be vaccinated, Liu said, suggesting that students and those working in cities should take the injections while people who live in rural areas with comparatively smaller populations do not have to. Two inactivated vaccine candidates developed by institutes under Sinopharm separately in Beijing and Wuhan were delivered into phase three clinical trials in the United Arab Emirates in June. Liu himself has also been injected with two doses of one of the inactivated candidates. So far, he said he felt no side effects. A workshop in Beijing able to produce 120 million doses per year has passed biological safety inspection from the related national authorities and is ready for production. Another workshop of Sinopharm in Wuhan is able to produce 100 million doses per year, Liu noted.

The British government on Tuesday announced its decision to integrate some of its key public health agencies into one new organization in a bid to advance the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Institute for Health Protection (NIHP) will bring together Public Health England (PHE) and NHS (National Health Service) Test and Trace, as well as the analytical capability of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) under a single leadership team from Tuesday. In order to minimize disruption to the vital work dealing with the pandemic, the organization will be formalized and operating from spring 2021, said the government. Besides the COVID-19, the newly formed NIHP will also conduct surveillance of all infectious diseases, provide specialistic scientific advice on immunization and countermeasures and carry out emergency response and preparedness to deal with the most severe incidents at national and local level, etc. To give ourselves the best chance of beating this virus once and for all -- and of spotting and being ready to respond to other health threats, now and in the future -- we are creating a brand new organisation to provide a new approach to public health protection and resilience, said Health Secretary Matt Hancock in a statement. Israel's COVID-19 project manager Ronni Gamzu said on Tuesday that he looks forward to further advancing the country's relations with China as both sides battle the spread of the virus. We are sharing information and experience and trying to use the Chinese experience and technology. Many of our tests are being performed by BGI technologies, a leading Chinese life science technology firm, Gamzu said in a video briefing for foreign journalists and diplomats. Israel has been facing a massive second wave of the COVID-19 virus since late May, said Gamzu, who was appointed by the Israeli government last month to lead the concerted efforts against COVID-19, adding that Israel was going on the tip but doing so in order to avoid lockdown again. After weeks of strict lockdown measures that began in the middle of March, the Israeli government eased measures in the middle of May. Soon after cases began to surge. We have to realize containing COVID-19 is not only medical challenge. It's a social, economic challenge that you have to balance, Gamzu said. The country is currently almost fully open, with only few restrictions in place, mainly on large gatherings. Other countries with a far less severe infection rate have already reinstated harsher restrictions and lockdown measures. I am trying to balance, to achieve what is possible for the sake of health and the country with gradual steps, he said. Gamzu said that his greatest challenge is that the government is facing the loss of credibility. The slow response to people's financial woes and often inconsistent and illogical directives have led many to doubt the government. The government is not taking steps because of lack of leadership, and it is not taking steps because there is leadership. We are pushing the entire system to try to combat and contain COVID-19 without a lockdown, Gamzu said. A set of commemorative coupons marking the 600th anniversary of the Forbidden City, the now Palace Museum, were issued on Tuesday. On the obverse of the coupon is the Hall of Supreme Harmony (Taihe Dian) in front of a bird's eye view of the entire imperial compound, while the reverse depicts a dragon from the Nine-dragon Screen (Jiulong Bi), a porcelain screen standing in the courtyard outside the Gate of Imperial Supremacy. The coupons were jointly issued by the Palace Museum and the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation. This year marks the 600th anniversary of the Forbidden City, an imperial palace of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, based on which the Palace Museum was built in 1925. The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that the world needs to prevent vaccine nationalism so as to guarantee the equitable access and fair allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. Speaking at a virtual press briefing from Geneva, the WHO head said that once a successful vaccine has been identified, WHO's strategic advisory group will provide recommendations for their appropriate and fair use. He told reporters that the allocation of vaccines is proposed to be rolled out in two phases. In phase 1, he said, doses will be allocated proportionally to all countries participating in the WHO-led vaccine development plan simultaneously to reduce the overall risk. And in phase 2, consideration will be given to countries in relation to threat and vulnerability. For most countries, a phase 1 allocation that builds up to 20 percent of the population would cover most of the at-risk groups, he said. The WHO chief stressed that only when those highest risk people from the virus everywhere and at the same time are protected, then the world can stabilize health systems and rebuild the global economy. Like an orchestra, we need all instruments to be played in harmony to create music that everyone enjoys, he said.
