You once said that what you like is the feeling that I am playing games while you are with me. Now, that feeling has disappeared, and there are only endless quarrels left. I take out my heart and lung to you, but you put a knife into my heart, and then pull out, and then tell me, you are just a little temper Can we still be friends? No. Why? Those who can be friends don't love or love deeply. I still remember I said to you, I know you cheated me a lot, but I don't blame you. Because I can't give up, so I'm willing. I think the most difficult thing is to forgive. I didn't know until that moment. In fact, what is difficult is not to forgive, but to trust and get along with each other after forgiveness. Last year, we met in the cold wind, this year, I return you to the sea of people in the spring wind. From then on, they forget each other in pairs, like strangers. I know, you want to ask why a person has changed his heart? And I can only tell you that after marriage, life is full of fireworks. I under the cherry tree, Acacia bridge, for you to light a hundred lights. Bright moon in the sky, red clothes and white hair, waiting for you to come back slowly. I seem to suddenly understand that I am not your love, but the most suitable. Like I love you, after all, it's just talk.
