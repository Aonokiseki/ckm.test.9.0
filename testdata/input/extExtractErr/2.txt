All gossip and short stories say that short stories are difficult to write. I think the difficulty of writing short stories mainly comes from the limitation of space. It's a bit like juggling. It needs to complete a high-level somersault in a very short time: jumping, rolling, spinning, landing In a word, we should have a head and a tail, and we should be able to retract and release freely. I mean, as far as the basic elements of the novel are concerned, short stories are indispensable. They are a Taoist temple in the shell of a snail. Although it is only one and a half leaves, it has to be constructed with the meaning of flourishing flowers and leaves. And good short stories, like all good arts, are always vague and uncertain, not just a story, a few characters, sound and smile, fate turning These are the external features of the novel. I think most of them can be called art. They all fall into one sign first, and then jump over it to point to the vast and rich. The so-called poetry has no interpretation, but the direction of poetry has an end?
