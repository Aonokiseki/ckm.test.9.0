Commentary:  20 days, the deadline for the implementation of the new national standard for electric motorcycles on January 1, next year, has been described by the media as the speed of life and death of electric bicycles. After 20 days, according to the new standard, electric bicycles with a speed of more than 20 km / h and a weight of more than 40 kg will be renamed as electric motorcycles. After driving test, registration and insurance, the owners should enter the motorway.  Since October this year, the National Standards Committee issued the new national standard for electric motorcycle, which has caused a lot of controversy and confusion from all walks of life. The bicycle association believes that the new national standard may cause urban traffic congestion and confusion. The units participating in the formulation are not representative and lack of credibility. It is a means for strong interest groups to use standards to set technical barriers and access barriers. In this regard, the person in charge of the motorcycle branch of the Automobile Standards Committee said that the standard of electric motorcycle was straightforward, they did not participate in the formulation of new standards, and the two industry standards were irrelevant.
