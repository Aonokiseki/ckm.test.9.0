The Chinese military opposes the United States ramping up its pressure and provocations against China, and promises to take every measure necessary to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests as bilateral relations face an unusually severe and complicated situation, the Ministry of National Defense said on Thursday.  When asked at a news briefing about increased US military activity around China, Senior Colonel Wu Qian, the ministry's spokesman, said that some US politicians are sabotaging China-US relations for selfish reasons and even deliberately want to create an accident or military conflict.  By doing so, Wu said, the US is disregarding the safety of front-line servicemen, the interests of people from both countries, and aspirations for peace around the world. It will not win over any hearts, he added.  The Chinese military will adamantly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and resolutely maintain peace and stability in the region and the world, he said.
